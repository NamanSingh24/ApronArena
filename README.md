# ApronArena
Our Website organizes cooking contests at local schools where users compete in categories like Italian cuisine or baking, judged on taste, presentation, and creativity. Users gain ratings based on contest performance and engage in a community with forums, groups, and learning resources to enhance their culinary skills.
